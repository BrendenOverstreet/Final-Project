This is a tkinter gui that allows a user to choose either basketball, football, or baseball and enter a value for attempts taken for goals, runs, or points scored. It then allows the user to enter how many at bats they had, how many field goal attempts they took, or how many shots they took. It then gives them their percentage back. This allows a sports player, coach, or fan see the effectiveness or performance the player had that game.
